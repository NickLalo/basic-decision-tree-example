## Tropical Cyclone Intensity Model using Decision Tree Classifier

This Jupyter Notebook trains a decision tree classifier to predict the 6-hourly intensity changes for tropical cyclones.  Since the majority of tropical cyclone intensities are recorded in 5 knot increments, a decision tree classifier is a suitable first model to try for this task.

## Environment
A conda environment to run this jupyter notebook can be created following the instructions in the comments of the _config/environment.yml file
